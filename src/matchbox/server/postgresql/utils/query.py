    This function creates SQL that determines which cluster each source record belongs

    The query uses `COALESCE` to implement a priority system where higher-level
    resolutions can "claim" records, with lower levels only processing unclaimed
    records:

    ```sql
    COALESCE(highest_priority_cluster, medium_priority_cluster, ..., source_cluster)

    1. **Lineage discovery**: Queries the resolution hierarchy to find all ancestor
        resolutions, ordered by priority (lowest level = highest priority)
    2. **Source filtering**: When `sources` is provided, constrains results to only
        include clusters from those specific source configurations
    3. **Threshold application**: Applies probability thresholds to determine which
        clusters qualify at each resolution level
    4. **Subquery construction**: For each model resolution in the lineage, builds
        a subquery that finds qualifying clusters via the Contains→Probabilities
        join. Each joined subquery adds a new cluster column which is then merged
        via...
    5. **`COALESCE` assembly**: Joins all subqueries to source data and uses `COALESCE`
        to select the highest-priority cluster assignment for each record

    The level changes the data returned:

    * `"leaf"`: Returns both root and leaf cluster IDs. For unmerged source
        clusters, the root and leaf properties will be the same.
    * `"key"`: In addition to the above, it also returns the source key. This will give
        more rows than `"leaf"` because it needs a row for every key attached to a leaf.
